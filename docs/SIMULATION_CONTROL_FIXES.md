# Simulation Control Fixes and Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the fixes and improvements made to the broken simulation control system in the Traffic Simulation application. The original implementation had several critical issues that caused the pause, start, restart, and stop functionality to work incorrectly or not at all.

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Critical Resource Management Bug**
**Issue:** The `stopSimulation()` method deleted the scene and generator objects but left dangling pointers, causing crashes when trying to restart.

**Original Code (BROKEN):**
```cpp
void RoadIntersectionSimulation::stopSimulation()
{
    if(m_State == SimulationState::STARTED || m_State == SimulationState::PAUSED){
        pauseSimulation();
        delete m_Scene;        // ❌ DANGEROUS - leaves dangling pointer
        delete m_Generator;    // ❌ DANGEROUS - leaves dangling pointer
        m_State = SimulationState::UNINITIALIZED;
    }
}
```

### 2. **Inconsistent State Management**
- State transitions were not properly validated
- No checks for valid state before operations
- Inconsistent timer management

### 3. **Poor Restart Logic**
- Restart button simply called `stopSimulation()` without proper reinitialization
- No proper cleanup and setup cycle

### 4. **UI Button State Issues**
- Button states were hardcoded instead of based on simulation state
- No validation of whether operations were allowed

### 5. **Timer Management Problems**
- Incorrect timer interval (TIME_STEP was 1/60 = 0, not 16ms)
- Timer not properly stopped in all cases

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Resource Management**

**New Implementation:**
```cpp
void RoadIntersectionSimulation::stopSimulation()
{
    qDebug() << "Stopping simulation. Current state:" << m_State;
    
    if(m_State == SimulationState::STARTED || m_State == SimulationState::PAUSED){
        // Stop the timer first
        if (m_SimulationTimer) {
            m_SimulationTimer->stop();
        }
        
        // Stop the generator
        if (m_Generator) {
            m_Generator->stopGenerator();
        }
        
        // Stop traffic control
        if (m_Scene && m_Scene->getController()) {
            m_Scene->getController()->stopTrafficLightAll();
            m_Scene->getController()->turnOffDetector();
        }
        
        // Clear the scene but don't delete it ✅
        if (m_Scene) {
            m_Scene->resetScene();
        }
        
        // Clean up generator only ✅
        if (m_Generator) {
            delete m_Generator;
            m_Generator = nullptr;
        }
        
        m_State = SimulationState::UNINITIALIZED;
        qDebug() << "Simulation stopped successfully. State:" << m_State;
    }
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced State Management**

**Added State Validation Methods:**
```cpp
bool RoadIntersectionSimulation::canStart() const
{
    return (m_State == SimulationState::INITIALIZED || m_State == SimulationState::PAUSED);
}

bool RoadIntersectionSimulation::canPause() const
{
    return (m_State == SimulationState::STARTED);
}

bool RoadIntersectionSimulation::canStop() const
{
    return (m_State == SimulationState::STARTED || m_State == SimulationState::PAUSED);
}
```

### 3. **Proper Restart Logic**

**New Restart Method:**
```cpp
void RoadIntersectionSimulation::restartSimulation()
{
    qDebug() << "Restarting simulation. Current state:" << m_State;
    
    // Stop the simulation first
    stopSimulation();
    
    // The simulation is now in UNINITIALIZED state
    // UI should trigger setup dialog to reinitialize and start
    qDebug() << "Simulation restart prepared. State:" << m_State;
}
```

### 4. **Smart UI Button Management**

**Added Centralized Button State Management:**
```cpp
void UIMainWindow::updateButtonStates()
{
    if (!m_Simulation) return;
    
    SimulationState state = m_Simulation->State();
    
    // Update button states based on current simulation state
    ui->m_simulation_play_button->setEnabled(m_Simulation->canStart());
    ui->m_simulation_pause_button->setEnabled(m_Simulation->canPause());
    ui->m_simulation_stop_button->setEnabled(m_Simulation->canStop());
    ui->m_simulation_restart_button->setEnabled(state != SimulationState::UNINITIALIZED);
    
    qDebug() << "Button states updated for simulation state:" << state;
}
```

### 5. **Fixed Timer Issues**

**Corrected Timer Interval:**
```cpp
m_SimulationTimer->start(16); // ~60 FPS (1000ms/60 ≈ 16ms)
```

**Added Proper Timer Management:**
```cpp
// Stop the timer first
if (m_SimulationTimer) {
    m_SimulationTimer->stop();
}
```

## New Control Flow

### **Start Simulation:**
1. Check if state allows starting (`canStart()`)
2. Start timer with correct interval
3. Start generator
4. Start traffic lights
5. Update button states
6. Set state to STARTED

### **Pause Simulation:**
1. Check if state allows pausing (`canPause()`)
2. Stop timer
3. Stop generator
4. Pause traffic lights
5. Update button states
6. Set state to PAUSED

### **Stop Simulation:**
1. Check if state allows stopping (`canStop()`)
2. Stop timer and generator
3. Clear scene (don't delete)
4. Clean up generator
5. Update button states
6. Return to main menu
7. Set state to UNINITIALIZED

### **Restart Simulation:**
1. Stop simulation (cleans up everything)
2. Update button states (disables all)
3. Show setup dialog
4. Wait for user input
5. Initialize with new parameters
6. Start simulation

## Testing the Fixes

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Start Simulation**: Should initialize and begin running
2. **Pause**: Should pause and allow resuming
3. **Resume**: Should continue from paused state  
4. **Stop**: Should stop and return to main menu
5. **Restart**: Should stop, show setup, and allow reinitializing
6. **Button States**: Should correctly reflect available actions
7. **Multiple Cycles**: Should handle start/stop/restart repeatedly without crashes

```
UNINITIALIZED → [Initialize] → INITIALIZED → [Start] → STARTED
                                    ↑              ↓ [Pause]
                                    |          PAUSED
                             [Restart/Stop]        ↓ [Resume]
                                    ↑          STARTED
                                    |              ↓ [Stop]
                                UNINITIALIZED ←────┘
```

The simulation control system is now robust, reliable, and provides a smooth user experience with proper state management and resource handling.
