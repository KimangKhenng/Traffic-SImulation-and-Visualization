# Road Intersection Simulation and Visulization

I've decided to open-source this source code under **GPLv3(GNU General Public License, version 3)** after my graduation from the university.

This is a intersection simulation software capable of generating the arriving vehicles in varying controllable rate. The vehicle behavior can be changed in realtime in the following mode:
obey the traffic lights or not, treat front vehicles are invisible or not.
