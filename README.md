I've  decided  to  open-source  this  source  code  under  **GPLv3(GNU  General  Public  License,  version  3)**  after  my  graduation  from  the  university.


This  is  a  intersection  simulation  software  capable  of  generating  the  arriving  vehicles  in  varying  controllable  rate.  The  vehicle  behavior  can  be  changed  in  realtime  in  the  following  mode:

obey  the  traffic  lights  or  not,  treat  front  vehicles  are  invisible  or  not.

```sh

$  git  clone  https://github.com/KimangKhenng/Traffic-SImulation-and-Visualization.git

```

##  Supported  systems



The  latest  version  is  available  for



*  Windows  7

*  macOS  10.12  and  above

*  Linux
