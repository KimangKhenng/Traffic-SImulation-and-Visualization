# Road Intersection Simulation and Visulization

![Logo](https://github.com/KimangKhenng/Traffic-SImulation-and-Visualization/blob/master/Image/Logo-AI.png?raw=true)

I've decided to open-source this source code under **GPLv3(GNU General Public License, version 3)** after my graduation from the university.

This is a intersection simulation software capable of generating the arriving vehicles in varying controllable rate. The vehicle behavior can be changed in realtime in the following mode:
obey the traffic lights or not, treat front vehicles are invisible or not.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/KimangKhenng/Traffic-SImulation-and-Visualization.git
```
## Supported systems

* macOS 10.12 and above
